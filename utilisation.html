            <h1>How much should you utilise a DAC plant?</h1>
            <h3><b>By <a href="https://twitter.com/_neilhacker">Neil Hacker</a></b></h3>

           <p>
            A utilisation rate is basically the percentage of time you are actually doing something. For example, with a DAC plant a 100% 
            utilisation rate would suggest you are actively using energy 24/7 to pull CO₂ out of the sky/separate it from your sorbent, 
            whereas a 50% utilisation rate would suggest you are only actively using energy for half of the day in order to remove CO₂.¹ 
            <label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
			<input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/>
			<span class="marginnote" id="id_option">
                ¹ This doesn't actually mean you are only able to create a stream of removed CO₂ for 50% of the day, just that you don’t need to actively be putting energy into your system for more than 50% of the day to remove CO₂
			</span> 
            <br><br>
            Some systems will work much better with very high utilisation rates, for example, systems that rely on using very high temperatures or pressures may find that unless they have high utilisation rates the wind up costs/time of getting back up to operating conditions become pretty much prohibitive. 
            <br><br>
            Other systems, like Parallel Carbon, could use energy for 50% of the day to electrolyse water, but then they could shut off their energy inputs for the other 50% of the day and just drip feed the alkaline ions they’ve created into their CO₂ solution to separate it out. 
            <br><br>
            Why does this matter? It matters because if you only need power for say 50% of the day this can radically change the way you are able to generate the power vs if you need power 100% of the day. If you only need power 50% of the day you can get there basically with renewables like solar or wind. If you need power above say 80% of the day you start needing to either use large scale battery storage, clean firm solutions like geothermal²
            <label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/>
            <span class="marginnote" id="id_option">
                ²  If you need really very high utilisation rates even something like geothermal has drawbacks. Mainly because to convert into electricity, which even temperature-swing sorbent DAC need for 10–25% of their power demand, it ends up costing around <a href="https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-levelized-cost-of-storage-and-levelized-cost-of-hydrogen/">3x more</a> for those MWh than intermittent renewables
            </span> 
            , or you have to tap into the grid (I’m sure you can tell why this would not be a great option from a life cycle analysis standpoint).
            <br><br>
            Let's have a look at an example to see how different energy costs can change what the optimal utilisation rate is.

            </p>
            <h2>Model</h2>
            <p>

               In this example we have a certain power schedule where we have different costs for MWh depending on how much utilisation 
               we're getting. I'm going to start with the default schedule below but you can either drag the values around or use the 
               sidebar to try some other pre-set options.

			<input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/>
			<span class="marginnote" id="id_option">
                Note that the prices in this chart denote the average cost of all MWh at a certain utilisation rate not the incremental cost increase.

                The second scenario uses renewables at ＄40/MWh until 65% utilisation then gets electricity from the grid at 
                ＄60/MWh, the reason it is an upward slope not a new flat line is because these costs represent the average of all tons 
                removed at a given utilisation. (Just to say this undersells the actual costs becuase you would be removing less net CO₂ if you 
                connect the grid)

            Next suppose we have a DAC plant that costs $<r-display bind="proj_1_cost"></r-display> to build, has an annual removal
            capacity of <r-display bind="proj_1_capacity"></r-display> tons, requires <r-display bind="proj_1_power_intensity"></r-display> MWh
            to remove a ton of CO₂ and has a capital recovery factor³ of <r-display bind="proj_1_crf"></r-display>%. 
            (You can either customise these values or pick from default options to the right.) 
            <!-- <br>

            Cost: $<r-display bind="proj_1_cost"></r-display>
            <br>
            Capacity: <r-display bind="proj_1_capacity"></r-display>
            <br>
            CRF: <r-display bind="proj_1_crf"></r-display>%
            <br>
            Power intensity: <r-display bind="proj_1_power_intensity"></r-display> MWh/t -->
            <br> <br>
            From these values we can calculate the cost of power which we get from mulitplying 
            power intensity by the cost per MWh (at whichever utilisation rate we are looking at). 
           <br> <br>
           \( Power &nbsp; cost = Power&nbsp; intensity * cost&nbsp; per&nbsp; MWh \)
            <br> <br>

            We can also calculate the cost of the CRF. To do this we get the project cost mulitply it by the CRF value and then
            divide this by the number of tons we're removing at a specific utilisation rate. 
            <br><br>
            \( CRF &nbsp; cost = \dfrac{Project&nbsp; cost * CRF}{Project&nbsp; capacity * utilisation&nbsp; rate} \)
            <br><br>
            Adding these values then gives us our total cost.
            <br><br>
            \( Total &nbsp; cost = Power&nbsp; cost + CRF &nbsp; cost \)

            <br><br>
            We can see these values plotted below.

            If you have kept the default power costs and are using plant 1 then you will probably see that the lowest cost per ton
            very close to 100% capacity. This is basically because you have such little capacity to recover your large CAPEX expenditure from 
            you just need to churn out tons. 
            <br><br>
            However, if you select plant 2 you will see that in this case the lowest levelised cost per ton is actually      around the 55%
            utilisation mark. What does this mean? It means that if you as the seller want to be able to charge the lowest price per ton (while still
            achieving some expected rate of return) you only want to run energy to your plant 55% of the time.

        </p>
        <h2>Theoretical consequences</h2>
        <p>
            This outcome has some pretty big consequences for both buyers and sellers. From the seller point of view if they want to be most 
            competitive and be able to charge the lowest price then it would benefit them if they could lower there utilisation rate to the range 
            with the lowest levelised DAC costs, i.e well below 100%. 
            <br><br>
            The consequence for the buyers though is much much more profound I think. To see why it is worth taking a moment to restate what the 
            goal of buyers is in the CDR sector. To some it is meeting annual net-zero targets, but as a group it is to maximise the speed with which we 
            can scale up CDR capacity. Even if we are only utilising our DAC plants at 50% in a given year, while this might seem to be leaving capacity on the table 
            if by doing so it allows us to scale the whole sector more quickly then that is by far preferable. What I'm saying here is that this is indeed very likley to be the case.
            <br><br>
            Why? Well consider plant 2 again. If it was operating at 50% capacity it would be selling 500,000 tons at ＄80/t, this would put the buyer
            on the hook for ＄40,000,000 a year. If however it was operating at 100% capacity it would be selling 1,000,000 tons at ＄180/t putting the annual cost to buyers at 
            ＄180,000,000 or 4.5x more.
            <br><br>
            This difference is incredibly important because in many ways that money is just wasted. You're not buying any more ability to scale capacity with that money, 
            we've already established that from the sellers point of view these two options actually give them the exact same expected rate of return so neither on would be any more prefereable. 
            <br><br>
            You're therefore not buying any more learning with your money either which could help the technology get cheaper in the future. While we might (and I have) thougth about learning rates 
            as a product of cumulatve tons removed this isn't really true. Once you've built the DAC modules/plant it doesn't really matter if it runs at 50% utilisation or 100% the "learning" so to speak has been 
            achieved already by making the thing itself. 
            <br><br>
            What this means is that all that extra money you're spending on the plant at 100% utilisation could instead be used to pay for 4 more plants all running at 50% utilisation. If you use your money in this way 
            you get much much more leverage out of it in speeding up the overal increase in CDR capacity. This could be rephrased from the buyers point of view to say that what they really want to do 
            is pay the absolute minimum amount required to allow a DAC plant to hit the needed expected rate of return to raise follow-on financing for new plants. The model above would suggest that this could be 
            achieved with over 4x less money if a plant was able to run at lower utilisation rates vs needing to run almost all of the time. 

        </p>
        <h2>Practical consequences</h2>
        <p>
            What this means in practice is that companies that can take advantage of intermittent energy supply rather than running at very high utilisation rates have a huge advantage 
            as you try to scale up the industry.
            <br><br>
            There's a reason we don't really care about the utilisation of any plant in any given year and that is that the output they are making until you reach any real scale doesn't really have any value except 
            in so far as it allows the companies to learn how to make the technology cheaper. It's not like solar that would be making useful KWh all the time which we might want to harness. No in this case all we care about
            is getting more capacity installed and if the model above has much to say on the matter the best way to do that is to find DAC sources that can run at lower utilisation rates.
        </p>

        <h2>Taking these ideas to their extremes</h2>
        <p>
            Let's take another quick look at the chart from above, this time only showing the total cost per ton. What would be best from the 
            buyers point of view is to pick a point on this line where the area under that point is smallest.

                I've called the y axis 'normalised' becuase it doesn't show the actual total cost to remove tons at given utilisation levels

            What you will find is that in virtually every case of pairing up plant stats with power costs this line is lowest at the lowest level of utilisation. 
            <br><br>
            What does this suggest? It suggests that if the buyer is primarily concerned with paying the least amount of money to a DAC plant so that it 
            hits some needed rate of return to allow follow on scale ups then they should basically have it produce no units of carbon removal at all and just pay the fixed CAPEX costs.
            <br><br>
            You can kind of understand why this is the case, CDR (for voluntary markets) is basically doing something that has no economic value and also once the plant is built 
            is providing very little in the way of learning effects. But it still seems like the above is pretty divorced from what we might have thought initially as the best path forward.

                I don't want to stretch an analogy too much but this is similar to a number of probability games where how you maximise the expected return on any given play and 
                how you maximise the expected growth of wealth over time end up being different strategies. 
			</span> 

            It's worth asking ourselves seriously when do we actually want to be pulling CO₂ out of the atmosphere. The above would suggest that doing so now actually imposes a very large 
            tradeoff with how quickly we can scale the sector as a whole. Of course you eventually want to turn on the taps to get things rolling but given how the entire sector will likely 
            have very little impact at all until decades from now in terms of how much it can remove there is a case to be made that tons today is the wrong metric to be maximising.

                ⁵ This point of knowing a company can pull tons out properly ends up being quite important. 
			</span> 

            If you take the ideas above to their extremes it would suggest buyers basically instantly pay the CAPEX costs for CDR plants that 
            would be able to⁵ pull CO₂ out of the sky and then have them sit idle while the company simply makes more plants that will similarly sit idle.             
        </p>
        <h2>What's wrong with the above</h2>
        <p>
            That last paragraph was kind of written to sound almost offensively against what you'd expect to be the case. But I want to stress again that based on the set up we have 
            above really does lead to us maximising many of the things we truly care about (i.e capacity and learning rates). It also seems clearly stupid, so what's up?
            <br><br>
            <b>Pragmatic issues</b>
            <br>
            There are some prgamatic reasons to reject my analysis above out of hand. Firstly can you even imagine the PR it would get, especially given how CDR has struggled 
            for any kind of acceptance for so long anyway. "US government pays weremovecarbon $100m to make some stuff and then throw it in a ditch"....not ideal.
            <br><br>
            The second pragmatic reason is that the buyers of CDR while being unusually forward looking compared to the norm would still probably find it difficult to sell to their 
            finance teams that they're buying future capacity increases and that alone and that no the money they've spent has not as of yet removed any tons from the 
            atmosphere that the company could use to reach their net-zero targets.
            <br><br>
            <label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
			<input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/>
			<span class="marginnote" id="id_option">
                ⁶ or at least far fewer tons removed every year than you could feasibly do. 
			</span> 

            This highlights how important exactly who is doing the paying is. The closer you get to some fully altruistic leviathan the closer you can implement the 
            strategy above as you can basically internalise the fact that you won't see many actual tons⁶ for a while. The closer you are to a group of buyers who 
            very much want to see large utilisation of CDR assets the less able you will be to do the above. 
            <br><br>
            <b>Learning effects</b>
            <br>
            Okay those are pretty pragmatic, and very much not to be ignored, but there's a critique that actaully exists within the model itself that 
            I think is very important here. It is that one of the main driving forces behind the end cost of all this is the learning rate these technologies 
            have. Above I've analysed things for a single plant at a single point in time but then argued that we shoudl take this conclusion and apply it as the best 
            thing to do over time as well. 
            <br><br>
            If for some reason we think that doing what I suggest above would in fact lead to lower learning rates then this effect would probably dwarf the money you save to re-invest. 
            So the question is would it reduce learning rates?
            <br><br>
            On one had the answer seems like no, you're still making the stuff so you should still be getting the learning-by-doing effects. However, 
            if you actually make plants produce more and then basically try to offer the lowest cost per ton possible this acts as a really good, and legibile,
             fitness function for them to optimise against. It also allows a much easier comparisson across multiple different projects. 
             <br><br>
             <b>Legibility and incentives</b>
             <br>
             Now to be fair 
             if you know the CAPEX of a plant and the operating costs in terms of energy and what not you could figure this value out for youself. 
             So instead of having plants sell tons you get their financials figure out what they would be able to sell tons for and then reward them based on lowering that.
            <br><br>
            While in theory this might have the same fitness function role it seems unlikely to me that that would be the case in reality. There's also the fact that you need to know that 
            when it came down to it the tech you're funding could in fact pull out the capacity it says it could, if you are using very low utilisation rates this might well be 
            harder to tell. This by no way means impossible, for example if you have multiple DAC modules that all operate in very similar ways you could imagine running a few at close to full 
            capacity to see how well they work but again, it seems like while this approach could work in theory in practice it would have drawbacks. 
            <br><br>
            <b>Supporting infrastructure</b>
            <br>
            Another reason why the above may not work so well is that it considers a DAC plant in isolation, but what if it uses a different company to acutally 
            sequesture the CO₂, you would now have to also pay that company money to...not sequester stuff(?). What if they have different cost structures? 
            <br><br>
            This also applies to renewable infrastructure, let's say you get down to 1.5MWh/t for removal, if we get to the stage of having the capacity to remove 1Gt/yr this would take 1500TWh. This is about 10 times larger
            than the current worldwide solar capacity of <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv">156 TWh</a> in 2020. At certain scales if you are only deploying 
            DAC plants but not actaully drawing the energy to run them given that they would end up being such a large part of the energy mix you risk not sufficiently 
            pulling solar production forward as well which means when the time comes you may have a lot of plants you can build cheaply but not enough renewables to actually opperate them.  
            <br><br>
            <b>MRV</b>
            <br>
            We might also want to consider MRV, which we might be able to get better at the more actual tons we are removing, although again with this it would seem like
            you wouldn't have to be removing millions of tons a year before we get better at this.  
            <br><br>
            <b>Market confidence</b>
            <br>
            Market confidence also does start to play a roll if we take this thinking to the extremes. If companies are removing reasonable amounts of CO₂ from all of their DAC plants and buyers 
            are buying these tons then it is more easy to believe that the market itself is healthy and balanced. If buyers go to the extreme of paying at very 
            low utilisation rates compnaies might wonder if there will eventually be enough money when we do seriously start to consider turning on the taps and removing CO₂. 
            <br><br>
            <b>Industry stage</b>

            The above might well be less true today than down the line a bit. At the moment when so many companies are trying to get the FOAK plant level, it will likely 
            lead to the fastest learning to actually be using DAC plants to full capacity to see how they opperate. However, the arguments above about buyers having heavy preferences
            towards very low utilisation rates becomes more true once we move to NOAK plants where there is quickly diminishing returns to learning by running all plants at high capacity. 
            In these situations we may really want to

        <h2>Where does this leave us?</h2>
        <p>
            There are two counterveiling forces we've talked about above. The first is that from the buyers side it might be in their interests to 
            pay out at lower utilisation rates. There are probably some pragmatic reasons we discussed above that would mean you couldn't go incredibly low like 10% utilisation.   
            Buyers would also want to consider what kind of utilisation rate is best for learning rates. If you penny pinch now by going for low utilisation rates and that shaves a few 
            percentage points off the learning rate companies will experience this will almost certainly come back to bite you.

                This bit is just talking about which utilisation rate corresponds to the lowest point on the green total cost line. 
			</span> 

            Another force pushing for higher (although by no means full) utilisation rates is that at these rates you might find the actual cheapest cost per tons a plant is 
            able to produce which is probably the simplest and easiest to understand metric for companies to try to directly maximise (or minimise I guess).
            <br><br>
            Where I think I come out on this is that you probably really want to try to support technologies that would be capable of operating at the utilisation rates with 
            the lowest cost per ton, but that as a buyer you might want to consider having companies go even lower than this, although how much lower remains to be seen for practical reasons. 
            <br><br>
            At the very least I hope this challenges people to think about what it is we actually want to maximise and what the most efficient way of achieving that is. We tend to 
            talk a lot about maximising tons removed which makes sense if you only think about 100% utilisation situations but if you go beyond those situations you may realise you want 
            to have a different strategy. 
            <br><br>
            A lot of this comes down to the fact these situations all seem very far away. At the moment we can kind of think of tons removed and DAC modules interchangably as all of the 
            volumes are so small. This means we haven't started to really think about how important the distinction between number of tons and number of modules is yet, and how important the 
            actual targets you are trying to hit from a project finance perspective are.

        <h2>Addendums</h2>
        <p>
            The first addendum is to say that above I've kind of made the assumption that companies that need to operate at very high utilisation rates and those that don't have similar learning rates all else considered. 
            If, for example, approaches with very high utilisation rates also had higher learning rates then this might make up for things. As it stands I find this hard to believe. Mainly because if you have a very high utilisation 
            rate that would suggest some structural complicated feature of your DAC set up which are typically systems that exhibit lower learning rates anyway.
            <br><br>
            The second addendum is that the above doesn't really hold if you can utilise your captured CO₂ in a way that makes you not reliant on voluntary payments (i.e sell it as an input). If this is the case then absolutly by all means it would probably make sense to
            churn out as many tons per year as you can.
