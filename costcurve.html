        <h1 id="title">Scaling up carbon removal</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This document is meant to look at the problem of scaling up carbon removal, specifically with a focus on 
            the financial aspects of this. The main questions are:
            <ul>
                <li>What should we be funding today
                </li>
                <li>How much might we expect to be spending/how does this change based on assumptions
                </li>
                <li>How might this funding come about/be focused 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you more interested in the technical details of various approaches then the recent(ish) 
            <a href="https://cdrprimer.org/">CDR Primer</a> is a great place to start. This essay is less about technical
            details and more about questions around resource allocationand costs. 
            <br><br>
            The main things I hope you take away from this document are:
            <ul>
                <li>To be on track to hit 10Gt of CDR by 2050 we need to start scaling up our efforts a lot, and right now</li>
                <li>We need to be channeling funding into many different types of CDR</li>
                <li>especially a lot more funding into areas that might have much higher costs per tonne today but which have the 
                    likelihood to scale this cost down as we ramp up our use of them</li>
                <li>If one of the main things we care about is hitting the target of 10Gt of removal a year then speed and cost are 
                    aligned, i.e the faster we scale the cheaper it will be in total</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            This document is a bit different to most in that I've tried to make calculations, somewhat, interactive and explained 
            step by step. Numbers in green are ones that you can slide to change the values of. For example, how will total costs 
            change if we scale up carbon removal faster or what will happen to total costs if we spend more of our budget today on 
            approaches with less of a learning effect? Numbers in blue are ones that are calculated from a mixture of our reactive 
            values, constants or data values. If you click on them I’ve tried to present the steps I went through to calculate them 
            in the margin.   

            <br><br>
            For the best experience if you can try to read this essay fullscreen on a computer rather than a phone.

        <h2 id="scale_of_problem">Scale of problem</h2>
        <p>
            This section aims to be a short bit of contextualising of how much CO₂ we need to remove, how quickly we 
            need to ramp up our capabilities, and how much this could cost.
    
        </p>

        <h3 id="emissions">Scale of emissions</h3>
        <p>
            <label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/>
            <span class="marginnote" id="growth base rates">  
                For a bit of scale: 
                <br>
                - The USA's emissions in 2019 were <usa-emissions></usa-emissions> tonnes.
                <br>
                - China's 2019 emissions were <china-emissions></china-emissions> tonnes.
                <br>
                - Worldwide 2019 CO₂ emissions from coal were <world-coal-emissions></world-coal-emissions> tonnes.
            </span> 

            We currently emit about 35 gigatonnes of CO₂ annually, of this between 1.5 and 3.1 gigatonnes are classed as hard 
            to avoid emissions and so we be very difficult to stop producing any time soon. If we want to get to net zero then 
            we will almost certainly have to not only reduce emissions but also remove CO₂ from the atmosphere. The scale of 
            carbon removal will almost certainly want to be higher than this hard-to-avoid emission rate however, in fact the IPCC
            report suggests that we will want to be at the scale of <b>10Gt a year</b> of carbon removal by 2050. 
            <br><br>
            Why will we need to do more
            removal than just the hard-to-avoid emissions? Simply put it's because we will likely not get our emissions all the way down
            to just these sources and even then being at net-zero will not reverse the increase of atmpospheric CO₂ it will will only 
            stop the acceleration of it. If we want to get back down to CO₂ levels of the past this will require the active drawdown 
            of historic emissions as well. 


        </p>

        <h3 id="capacity">Scale of capacity</h3>
        <p>
            To reach our 10Gt target will require absolutely huge scale ups in current methods of CDR. 
            One question to ask is what would these scale ups resemble? Are they literally out of the 
            scope of anything we have done before or are they 'just merely' a lot?
            <br><br>

            If we consider a CDR strategy that currently removes
            <r-dynamic class="currentCO2removal" onmouseover="hoverByClass('currentCO2removal','#E4FFED')" 
            bind="currentCO2removal"  min="0" max="1000000" step="10"></r-dynamic> 
            tons a year and we want to scale this to reach
            <r-dynamic class="targetCO2removal" onmouseover="hoverByClass('targetCO2removal','#E4FFED')"

            tons a year by 2050, i.e in 30 ish years time, then this would mean scaling up our tons removed 
            <r-display class="co2removalScaleUp" onmouseover="hoverByClass('co2removalScaleUp','#E4FFED')"

            bind="co2removalAnnualGrowthRate" onclick="sidebar('yearsTo10Gt')"></r-display>%.

            Looking at the above rates of scaling we see the extent of the challenge in front of us. <b>We will need to scale 
            up carbon removal technologies at the rate of some of our fastest growing technologies in the 
            world today. </b>
            <br><br>
            Many of the tecnologies above were/are heavily subsidised by governments around the world and recieved billions in funding from 
            governments for R&D. Many, specifically the energy related ones, have the added benefit of being general purpose 
            technologies which means that the demand for them if they get cheap enough is basically infinte. If solar became incredibly cheap
            then the question of who would want to buy it sorts itself out almost instantly. This helped enable a clear path to who would 
            buy the product if you could get it cheap enough, everyone. 
            <br><br>
            While very much against the traditional definition a clean atmosphere is a pretty good contender for a wholly different 
            kind of general purpose technology and so if you class cdr strategies as enablers of this then it is a new kind of framing 
            that adds to their importance.

                Try changing the cost per tonne for carbon removal &or the number of tonnes and see how the total cost
                changes in relation to the other base line values.
            </span>

            How much will it cost to remove carbon from the atmosphere? Again it might be useful
            to give some base rates as to how much other things cost to give us some perspective.
            For example:
            <br>
            - The total cost of oil demand in 2019 was <oil-demand-cost-2019></oil-demand-cost-2019> billion
            <br>
            - The 2019 USA military budget was <usa-military-spending></usa-military-spending>
            <br>
            - 2011 compliance costs for the Clean Air Act were <clean-air-act></clean-air-act>
            <br>
            - 2017 direct fossil fuel subsidies were <fossil-fuel-subsidies></fossil-fuel-subsidies>
            <br>
            - 2017 renewable subsidies were <renewable-subsidies></renewable-subsidies>
            <br>
            - The cost of the Apollo moon missions (adjusted for inflation) was <apollo-mission-cost></apollo-mission-cost>
            <br><br>
            Currently it costs between 1000 to 100 dollars to remove a tonne of carbon from the atmosphere. Let's suppose that 
            on average it cost

                We can use the equation \(C_x = C_1 x^{log_2(b)} \).
                Going through each part of this we have:  <br>
                \(C_x \) as the cost of the \(x^{th} \) unit <br>
                \(C_1 \) is the cost of the \(1^{st} \) unit <br> 
                \(b = 1- l \) where \( l \) is the learning rate, the decimal verion of the % decrease in cost per doubling of cumulative volume i.e 20% → 0.2 <br>
                <br> 
                Let's apply this to our example above. Now we don't know \(C_1 \) but there is a way to calculate it if you know 
                what \(C_x \) for some value of \(x \) and the learning rate \(l \). If you do some rearranging you get 
                \(C_1 = \dfrac{C_x}{x^{log_2(b)}} \). In our example the learning rate = 20% so \(b = 1- l  = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8\)
                we also know that when \(x = 10 \) then \(C_x = 1000 \). Putting this all together we can get 
                \(C_1 = \dfrac{1000}{10^{log_2(0.8)}} = 2098.6\). We can then plug this into our original equation to get the 
                general form of \(C_x = 2098.6 x^{log_2(0.8)} \) and this is the equation of the line you see on the graph.

            A cost curve is a way of looking at the unit cost of a technology and how this changes as we scale up the production
            of this technology. Typically this involves describing the % decrease in unit price for a doubling in the 
            cumulative volume of this technology, we then call this % decrease in cost the learning rate. For example if a

                Let's say we are currently producing 10 units of a good at a price of $600 per unit.

                Over time we increase the total cumualtive units made first to 20 units then to 40 units. Each doubling of cumulative units
                is associated with a 20% decrease in the per unit price of this good.

                We can then use these historic decreases in cost to forecast what the costs might look like in the future if this trend was

        <h3 id="cc_relevance">Relevance to CDR</h3>
        <p>
            How might we expect things like DAC to scale down their costs? The short answer is we really aren't too sure 
            at the moment. This is one of the reasons why we need to be funding multiple shots at various approaches so we 
            can get a better understanding of what might scale and what might not. However, we can look at a few factors to at 
            least make some kind of informed guess.

            <b>Historical base rates</b>
            <br>
            Many frontier CDR strategies resemble, at a high level, many other industrial processes. They use energy, chemicals 
            require supporting infrastructure etc. While there is a reasonable range of learning rates for many comparable products 
            like this the below should give some indication of historically how we might orient our base rates.

            This chart is meant to be illustrative. These technologies did not all start with the same unit cost and 
            certaintly didn't all manage to continue scaling cumulative capacity the same amounts as each other, transistors
            for example have scaled much more than anything else in this list and so have also seen much larger price declines. 
            What this chart is meant to do is show the range of learning rates various other technologies have experienced at some 
            point.

            <b>Material costs</b>
            <br>
            There is fair reason to think that costs might fall a fair amount on the material side. While it is of course not a 
            1-for-1 comparison a study looking to disentangle the various causes of price declines in lithium ion batteries found 
            that the largest contributor to these declines was R&D specifically around “advancements in chemistry and materials science”. 
            If we look at an estimated cost breakdown for solid sorbet DAC systems we can see that the largest single contributor is the 
            contractor array for which advances in material science, for example with MOF's, would be able to make large gains here.

        <p>
            <b>Energy floor</b>
            <br>
            One potential issue with cost scaling for many of these approaches will be that energy might present somewhat of a price 
            floor. To be sure better chemistry could lead to less energy per ton to be needed and energy prices, especially renewable 
            ones which would be the ones powering our cdr systems, will likely fall more, but you can’t scale costs down forever if you 
            have to pay for energy. Depending on the energy resource, capturing 1 MtCO2/yr requires 180 – 500 MW of power (CDR primer ch2), 
            at current prices this would put a floor of, at minimum
            Solar pv module price is around $0.38 a Watt 
            $68.4 to $190 potential price floor at current energy prices
            If we are at the higher end of this power usage limit then this price floor could prove to be a real obstacle to our ability 
            to scale at an affordable price.

                \( Total Cost = \sum_{k=Q_a}^{Q_b} C_1 k ^{log_2 (b)} \)
                <br><br>
                Now there is actually no closed form solution to this that is nice at all, it involves Bernoulli numbers and 
                then some other complications. However, we can approximate this summation with an integral (Euler–Maclaurin 
                formula etc). 
                <br><br>
                \( Total Cost ≈ \int_{Q_a -1}^{Q_b} C_1 x ^{log_2 (b)} dx \)

                \( = C_1  [ \dfrac{1}{log_2(b)+1} x ^{log_2(b)+1}]_{Q_a -1}^{Q_b}  \)

                \( = z (Q_b^{log_2(b)+1} - (Q_a -1)^{log_2(b)+1})  \)
                <br><br>
                Where \( z = \dfrac{C_1}{log_2(b)+1}  \)
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                First we need to find the cumulative tonnes (Qb) of CO₂ we will have removed by the time we get to 10Gt annually.
                We can do that by summing the tonnes removed each year with the equation below:
                <br><br>
                \( Q_b = \sum_{k=0}^{t} C (1+\dfrac{r}{100})^{k} \)
                <br><br>
                \(  = C \sum_{k=0}^{t} (1+\dfrac{r}{100})^{k} \)
                <br><br>
                Now this is the sum of a geometric series and so we can use the following closed form expression.
                <br><br>
                \( Q_b = C \dfrac{1-(1+\dfrac{r}{100})^{t+1}}{1-(1+\dfrac{r}{100})} \)
                <br><br>
                We need to make two adjustments to this to avoid double counting, these being subtracting the tonnes of CO₂ removed 
                this year, and adding the cumulative tonnes removed up unitl this year.
                <br><br>
                \( Q_b = C \dfrac{1-(1+\dfrac{r}{100})^{t+1}}{1-(1+\dfrac{r}{100})} - C + Qa \)
                <br><br>
                \( Q_b = \) <r-display class="cumulativeScaleTo10Gt" onmouseover="hoverByClass('cumulativeScaleTo10Gt','#E4FFED')" 
                bind="cumulativeScaleTo10Gt"></r-display> tonnes
                <br><br>
                Now we can use the same integral we used for the last example to calculate the total cost of these tonnes of CO₂ 
                removed. To do this we will also need these values from before:
                <br><br>
                Qa = 
                <r-dynamic class="cumulativeCarbonRemovalAmount" onmouseover="hoverByClass('cumulativeCarbonRemovalAmount','#E4FFED')" 
                bind="cumulativeCarbonRemovalAmount"  min="0" max="100000" step="1"></r-dynamic> tonnes
                <br>
                \(C_1 = \) $<r-display class="wrightsLawC1" onmouseover="hoverByClass('wrightsLawC1','#E4FFED')" 
                bind="wrightsLawC1" ></r-display> (this is the same as in the previous example)
                <br>
                L = 
                <r-dynamic class="wrightLearningCurve" onmouseover="hoverByClass('wrightLearningCurve','#E4FFED')" 
                bind="wrightLearningCurve" after="%" min="0" max="100" step="0.1"></r-dynamic>
                & b = 1 - L 
                <br><br>
                \( Total Cost ≈ \int_{Q_a -1}^{Q_b} C_1 x ^{log_2 (b)} dx \)
                <br><br>
                Total Cost = $<r-display class="totalCostToCbVolExample" onmouseover="hoverByClass('totalCostToCbVolExample','#E4FFED')" 
                bind="totalCostToCbVolExample"></r-display>
            </span>

            Let's look at a slightly different case, we're going to look at the cost of scaling up annual volume 
            up to 10Gt a year. This time suppose we are currently removing 
            <r-dynamic class="currentCarbonRemovalAmount" onmouseover="hoverByClass('currentCarbonRemovalAmount','#E4FFED')" 
            bind="currentCarbonRemovalAmount"  min="0" max="10000" step="1"></r-dynamic> 
            tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere at a unit cost of 
            $<r-dynamic class="costperton" onmouseover="hoverByClass('costperton','#E4FFED')" 
            bind="costperton"  min="0" max="1000" step="1"></r-dynamic>. 
            To locate ourselves on the cost curve also suppose cumulatively we have removed 
            <r-dynamic class="cumulativeCarbonRemovalAmount" onmouseover="hoverByClass('cumulativeCarbonRemovalAmount','#E4FFED')" 
            bind="cumulativeCarbonRemovalAmount"  min="0" max="100000" step="1"></r-dynamic>
            tonnes of carbon in total & again our learning rate is 
            <r-dynamic class="wrightLearningCurve" onmouseover="hoverByClass('wrightLearningCurve','#E4FFED')" 
            bind="wrightLearningCurve" after="%" min="0" max="100" step="0.1"></r-dynamic>.
            Now if we increase our tonnes removed by 
            <r-dynamic class="yearlyIncreaseInTonnesPerc" onmouseover="hoverByClass('yearlyIncreaseInTonnesPerc','#E4FFED')" 
            bind="yearlyIncreaseInTonnesPerc"  min="0" max="100" after="%" step="1"></r-dynamic>
            a year in will take 
            <r-display class="yearsTo10Gt" onmouseover="hoverByClass('yearsTo10Gt','#E4FFED')" 
            bind="yearsTo10Gt" onclick="sidebar('yearsTo10Gt')"></r-display>
            years for us to reach a 10Gt scale and total cost of this increase will be approximately 
            $<r-display class="totalCostToCbVolExample" onmouseover="hoverByClass('totalCostToCbVolExample','#E4FFED')" 
            bind="totalCostToCbVolExample" onclick="sidebar('CbTo10Gt')"></r-display>.
            
            <br><br>
            One thing to really emphasise about the example is the effect of changing the amount we are scaling up removal each year.
            Currently this is set to <r-dynamic class="yearlyIncreaseInTonnesPerc" onmouseover="hoverByClass('yearlyIncreaseInTonnesPerc','#E4FFED')" 
            bind="yearlyIncreaseInTonnesPerc"  min="0" max="100" after="%" step="1"></r-dynamic>
            & at this rate, with our other set values, it will take us 
            <r-display class="yearsTo10Gt" onmouseover="hoverByClass('yearsTo10Gt','#E4FFED')" 
            bind="yearsTo10Gt" onclick="sidebar('yearsTo10Gt')"></r-display> years 
            to get to our 10Gt of removal a year target. The thing I really want to emphasise is that if we increase the yearly 
            growth rate, while it means paying more in any given year it also means that the total cost to scale to our 10Gt 
            target actually <i>falls</i>. The reasoning for this is just that if we scale slowly then we are spending more 
            years still paying a lot for carbon removal but not actually yet at our target rate. This leads to the result 
            that in our race to 10Gt a year <b>increasing speed and minimising total cost work with not against each other</b>.           
        </p>
        <p>
            The above is clearly an oversimplification, we assume:
            <ul>
                <li>A known, and constant, learning rate</li>
                <li>A single learning rate across all approaches</li>
                <li>Constant yearly scaling of capacity (sometimes at massive levels)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Hopefully it can still serve as a useful guide for the order of magnitude we might be expecting to pay at 
            and how important things like the learning rate are for our calculations.
        </p>

        <h2 id="portfolio">Portfolios</h2>
        <p>
            There are two types of portfolios that we can talk about. 
        </p>
        <h3 id=approaches>Portfolio of apporoaches</h3>
        <p>
            We can broadly split most CDR approaches into two main camps. 
            Camp one is nature based solutions. These are things like afforestation & reforestation, soil sequestration, 
            biochar and ocean interventions. Camp two are technological solutions; these mainly include DAC, enhanced weathering. 
            Some interventions somewhat fall into both camps such as BECCS or genetically modifying trees/plants/plankton to capture 
            more CO₂. 
            <br><br>
            Again broadly each class of solutions has some common drawbacks that mean using any single intervention would likely 
            struggle to get to the full scale we need.
            <br>
            - Nature based solutions have land and water use as major constraints to how much we can expect them to be able to scale.
            <br> 
            - Technological solutions tend to have energy and therefore cost as major barriers to scaling up.
            <br><br>
            It should be noted as well that these two groups also tend to differ more in other ways. Nature based solutions tend to 
            simply impact humans in more ways than technological ones and so have as we mentioned downsides in terms of water/land 
            usage but also tend to have more co-benefits than technological ones such as improving biodiversity. 
            <br><br>
            Another broad difference is in terms of permanence. Nature based solutions tend to have lower levels of permanence guarantees 
            than technological solutions or BECCS. This is largely because the process is more easily reversible. Trees can be cut or 
            burnt down, soil or agricultural practices can change, all of which lose some of the benefits from these approaches. 
            Technological solutions typically involve much more permanent forms of sequestration like injecting carbon underground or 
            using it to cure cement. These are very difficult to reverse and so are much more likely to keep carbon locked away for a 
            long time. […microsoft issues with long term storage].
            <br><br>
            Another large difference is additionality. This isn't such a large issue when it comes to looking at theoretical amounts 
            of CDR that could be created but can be an issue when looking at specifically which things to be funding. For example, we 
            might know that soils could sequester …. more carbon with certain practices, however, we need to direct funds to specific 
            soil projects and some of the time it might not be so clear if a particular project would lead to an increase in CDR vs the 
            counterfactual. […microsoft issues with additionality ].
            <br><br>  
            Technological solutions again are usually much more clear about their additionality. If you put a big fan somewhere and 
            it sucks 4000 tons of CO₂ a year you can be pretty sure that this is 4000 more tons of CO₂ removed from the air than if 
            there was no big fan. This is somewhat of an oversimplification, in reality you need to look at the lifecycle analysis of 
            the whole cdr system to see what the additionality would be, i.e what carbon was produced to make the system, to power it, 
            to transport and store the carbon? Still while these things add complexity the counterfactual is much clearer. 
            <br><br>
            Despite it seeming like technological solutions have an edge in many different areas, it should be taken from the above to 
            suggest that they are better. Two things should be made clear. 
            <br>
            - We will <b>almost certainly need both</b> technological and nature based solutions
            <br> 
            - <b>At the moment technological ones cost a lot</b>. 
            <br><br>
            In fact if we look at this table from the <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/25259/chapter/2#5">NAS report</a> the levels of 
            “Safe Potential Rate of CO2 Removal Possible Given Current Technology and Understanding and at ≤$100/t CO2” for 
            DAC is 0, because at the moment it is just so expensive. In a similar vein the rates for carbon mineralisation 
            are unknown as the tech is simply so untested at scale.
            <br><br>

            <span class="marginnote" id="cost comparison graph">
                You might say that this is an unfair comparison as if we have multiple approaches all starting from the same level
                as the single approach then the outcome is purely due to the difference in starting tons. This is true but is also 
                not too disimilar to real life.  
            </span>
            This is going to be a bit coarse but one clear benefit of having multiple approaches (and this also holds to some extent 
            for projects) is that it simply decreases the amount any needs to scale to hit some fixed target. To make this a bit more

        <h3 id="projects">Portfolio of projects</h3>
        <p>
            In some ways this serves a similar function to the 
            portfolio of approaches. Any given project/specific instantiation of an approach, may have certain scale limitations 
            placed upon it. You might want to scale up a specific type of carbon mineralisation but maybe at some point you will 
            hit real difficulties obtaining the needed materials. 
            </br></br>
            There is of course another reason why you would want a portfolio of approaches within any given category and that is 
            because many of them will fail. This could be because the science just doesn't end up being able to scale, but we couldn't 
            know that until we tried. It might be for more normal reasons like founders falling out or simple project financing failures. 
            It also might be because even though some approaches might get us to scale eventually some will be able to do it faster, and 
            again we might simply not be able to tell until we try.

            Many carbon removal technologies are pretty nascent in their development and we're not yet certain how far they can scale,
            how cheap they can get, and how much carbon they will ultimately be able to remove. Suppose for now though that 
            any given approach has a 
            <r-dynamic class="probabilityOfSuccessIndividual" onmouseover="hoverByClass('probabilityOfSuccessIndividual','#E4FFED')" 
            bind="probabilityOfSuccessIndividual"  min="0" max="100" after="%" step="1"></r-dynamic> 
            chance of getting to the 10Gt per year target, to have a

            bind="probabilityOfSuccessOverall"  min="0" max="100" after="%" step="1"></r-dynamic> 
            chance of getting at least one viable technology we would need to invest in and start scaling up around

            bind="numberOfTries"></r-display> 
            technologies today. 
            <br><br>
            The exact numbers are not really what I want to emphasis here it is more that <b>if we want to have a chance of getting a 
            working option</b> and we are still at a stage where we have many unknowns around what could work, what could scale, how 
            quickly things could scale, then this <b>almost certainly requires us to cast a wide net</b> and fund many options in order 
            to end up backing the handful that do work.   
        </p>

        <h2 id="allocation">Allocation</h2>
        <p>
            We need to be spending money scaling up carbon removal today and how we spend this money really matters. 
            We could simply be spending it all on nature based solutions that are proven to work and have a low cost per 
            tonne. While this in theory could get us to the 10Gt per year target this would not be long term sequestrations and we 
            would likely hit some really pretty difficult tradeoffs in terms of land, water etc before we get there. 
            <br><br>
            We will almost certainly need a portfolio of approaches to hit a 10Gt a year target. This portfolio if we want to avoid 
            some of the more difficult tradeoffs to do with nature based solutions will almost certainly want to include technological 
            options. While these are too expensive today to be of much use, what do we have to do to make them viable options in the 
            future?

        <h2 id="funding">Funding</h2>
        <p>
            One general point to make is that obviously this is a two sided market you have companies that are creating a service 
            (cdr) and buyers who are buying the service (tons of carbon removed) How we think about the two sides though is quite 
            different. The supply side, for technological solutions, is going to be made up of a handful of firms who need money, 
            but also talent. The demand side will be made up of buyers who by in large will only be providing money. 
            <br><br>
            The supply side will be providing a semi-commodity but the semi distinction is an important one, geologic storage in one 
            place is to a large extent analogous to geologic storage in another (LCAs being equivalent and all), but geologic storage 
            in one place and a forest in another really aren't the same, for reasons hopefully made clear by now. The demand side is 
            providing something much closer to a commodity good, money. Again there are important reasons why it is not a strict 
            commodity, getting your product brought in a guaranteed way over a long time horizon creates opportunities that selling 
            one offs to any willing customer doesn't but the point stands that on the scale of commodityness the demand side is much 
            more fungible. 
            <br><br>
            It is also drawing from a much wider area, or in other words there are more dollars that could in principle be spent on 
            buying CDR than there are scientists and engineers who could work on it. For these reasons it would be exceptionally 
            unfortunate if the demand side was ever the bottleneck holding up progress. 
            <br><br>
            It should, as much as we can, be the case that if something is slowing down the scaling of potentially variable cdr 
            strategies it is because running and scaling a frontier tech company is difficult, not because no one will buy your 
            stuff. (and even then we should be trying to make the company bit easier). In a situation as critical as reaching our 
            cdr targets, missing them because of not having enough money would be the most unfortunate and lamentable reason possible.
            <br><br>
            While mentioned earlier that a ton is not a ton is not a ton it is also true to some extent that a dollar is not a dollar 
            is not a dollar.

            Given the global importance of reducing carbon in the atmosphere you would expect governments to be playing a very 
            large role in trying to help these technologies become cheaper. The good news is that governments are starting to ramp 
            up funding for these technologies
            <br><br>
            <b>Grants</b>
            <br>
            The UK has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/direct-air-capture-and-other-greenhouse-gas-removal-technologies-competition/projects-selected-for-phase-1-of-the-direct-air-capture-and-greenhouse-gas-removal-programme">
            just announced the 24 projects</a> it will be backing for experiments into DAC. They have 
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-a-new-deal-for-britain">also announced up to $100m</a>
            in new funding for dac R&D.
            <br><br>
            The us government similarly has recently put out a request for information from their newly formed department of 
            fossil energy and carbon management for things to look into funding and they have currently put aside a budget of … 
            for direct R&D funding for frontier cdr areas.
            <br><br>

            <b>VC</b>
            <br>
            VC money is also rapidly moving into the cdr space. There are a few caveats however. Ultimately vc's aim to make money 
            from their investments. There are two ways for cdr companies to make money, the first is to sell the actual long term 
            removal of CO₂ either on a voluntary market or to the government, the other is to use the CO₂ in a product that also 
            sequesters long term (e.g carbon cure). 
            <br><br>
            One issue with the second option is that as Klaus Lacker points out we create far more CO₂ than all the gravel and sand 
            output in the world so while these types of approaches could scale a lot they will almost certainly not take us enough 
            of the way.
            <br><br>
            An issue with the former, sell to companies/governments, is that the very companies that might need vc dollars the most i.e 
            high tech not ready for market yet, are also the ones who produce a good at above market rate and so may not be able to 
            find a steady stream of buyers. To some extent this doesn't seem to have been too bad as companies like carbon engineering 
            or climeworks have seen large amounts of funding but it still is likely holding back even more money from moving in.
            <br><br>
            <b>Project finance</b>
            <br>
            Project finance is a typical way by which long term infrastructure projects are able to pay for their 
            creation/construction which typically involve using the projects expected cashflows for repayments. This kind of 
            financing is one of the primary vehicles renewable company used to scale projects and will likely be crucial for the 
            scaling up of various cdr approaches as well. 
            <br><br>
            Project finance is intimatly linked to the demand side of the equation as you are typically directly using cashflows to 
            get the financing in the first place. What this allows is for the scale up of much large infrastructure facilities, and 
            in a non dilutive way. Many CDR strategies are simply too early and in too much of an immature market to be able to 
            sell their tons of carbon removed in this way allowing them to scale. 
            <br><br>
            Also the more nascent approaches have the added problem of trying to sell tons removed well above 'market rates', which
            creates the problem of who would buy them → little demand → can't get financing → can't scale → can't get cheaper.
            <br><br>
            This is clearly not a totally preventative problem, comapies are still getting government and VC funding but project financing
            allows access to truly massive scale of capital and in the race to 10Gt even though we have other funding avenues every one 
            is crucial. 
            <br><br>
            <b>Milestone based funding</b>
            <br>
            One of the most effective blends of government funding with private companies came from the NASA COTS programme in the 
            early 2000s. The US was decommissioning the space shuttle and needed a way to run resupply missions to the ISS without 
            having to pay another country to do it. What they did was to effectively run a request for proposals for any companies 
            who wanted to propose a launch system. These were then assessed on a number of factors, likelihood of technically working, 
            cost etc, and then ultimately two companies were chosen.
            <br><br>
            There were a few main differences to this kind of process to normal government procurement:
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    The government only gave specifications on what needed to be achieved not the specific methods by which to 
                    achieve them (result oriented not process oriented)
                </li>
                <li> 
                    They paid out based on milestones rather than a cost plus model. If the company hit a certain technical milestone 
                    on their roadmap the government gave them a set amount of money. This put more risk onto the individual companies 
                    as they would be responsible for paying for cost overruns. It also meant the government only paid out as specific 
                    progress was made. This helped derisk the government from massive cost overruns.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The end result was that one of the companies funded was spacex and the government saw its costs to resupply the ISS plummet 
            by almost an order of magnitude while at the same time the most successful space company in the world was able to be born.
            <br><br>
            This kind of approach seems to lend itself almost perfectly to the position we are in with cdr.

        <h3 id="demand">Demand</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Voluntary carbon market</b>
            <br>
            One thing that is happening today are that private companies like stripe, shopify and microsoft, are coming into the carbon 
            removal space and offering to buy removal capacity far above market rates in order to try to help various companies scale 
            and move down their cost curves. 
            <br><br>
            When stripe started their carbon purchasing they started with $1m, which is an insanely small amount and yet they reported 
            that this amount of capital was at the time a huge deal for the companies involved. In fact stripe has gone on to be the 
            literal first customer of a number of the companies they back.
            <br><br>
            While the figures are not yet public stripe has also allowed companies on their platform to directly contribute a percentage 
            of their revenue towards the companies stripe is buying from thus providing what is likely a reasonably sized, and maybe more 
            importantly recurring, source of funds for these companies. 
            <br><br>
            Voluntary carbon markets for frontier cdr approaches are still not very large though. Some of this is a supply issue, 
            microsoft found it actually impossible given the submissions they had for their spending to find enough long term 
            sequestration companies to get to their net zero targets. Some of the issue though is demand based. At the moment net-zero 
            pledges largely treat a ton of carbon removed by a forest the same as one that is injected underground or mineralised. 
            While we will need to scale up nature based solutions as well what this does is mean that many companies if they are simply 
            trying to hit their net zero target do not have an incentive currently to buy the well above market priced carbon removal 
            from the more frontier approaches.   
            <br><br>
            <b>Carbon purchase agreements</b>
            <br>
            Energy sources such as solar and wind benefitted massively from Power purchase agreements (PPAs) which were long term agreements by companies/governments 
            to buy energy from specific projects. This enabled these projects to literally take this commitment to the bank where they 
            could then raise project financing to either expand their portfolio of renewable energy projects or build specific ones using 
            the agreement.
            <br><br>
            Buying a few years worth of RECs from a renewable project does not provide the stable and sizable cash stream that a 
            renewable project developer needs to get financing to build new green power projects. In a PPA, Google is agreeing to buy 
            all the power from a project for many years. Google has, in effect, totally accepted the power price risk that the project
            owner would otherwise face—instead of taking the risk of selling into the power market on a short-term basis, Google is 
            providing the seller with a guaranteed revenue stream for 20 years. This is something the developer can literally take to 
            the bank”
            <br><br>
            Google emphasises this bankability later in the document as well where they say that if they only brought the RECs this would
            provide the energy providers with only a fraction of the benefit of going all in with a PPA. It is interesting to contrast 
            this with the way voluntary carbon markets work today. Currently we are largely in the buying just the REC phase of many 
            markets, especially for frontier technologies.
            <br><br>
            It should be noted that the UK currently has the Woodland Carbon Guarantee which allows for the option to sell captured 
            carbon to the government at a guaranteed price. This is a great initiative and should probably be copied more around the 
            world, however, it still doesn't necessarily help frontier companies. If they are likely to produce a tonne of removed 
            carbon for well above the price guarantee then selling to the government does little to help them gain a positive expected 
            value with which to finance their projects. In their case they may well need much more specific agreements for buying from 
            their specific facilities with the expectation that the carbon removed will have a higher price per tonne than other sources
            but that this will allow these companies to fund more project expansion to move down their cost curves.
            <br><br>
            This doesn't really happen at the moment. We see some companies like stripe or shopify that are buying from frontier companies
            at above market rates but not necessarily in a more formalised long term way. This is not necessarily a bug, at least at 
            this point. …explore vs exploit …etc
            <br><br>
            There are some big differences between what google did and what might/does need to be done with CDR. Google specifically 
            says that they “always try to buy renewable energy from the most cost-competitive sources within the grids where we operate.” 

            <br><br>
            <b>Advanced market commitments</b>
            <br>
            Advanced market commitments are when some group guarantees to buy a given output as long as a certain set of criteria 
            is met. For example back in …. There was a $1.5bn AMC to buy pneumococcal vaccines for developing countries. The idea was 
            that the AMC allows both market forces and subsidy like interventions to interact to help create conditions that private 
            firms would find more favorable to go and try to create a vaccine candidate in. One of the main reasons the AMC is so useful 
            is that it avoids having to pick which companies to buy from ex-ante and instead lets companies that believe they can make a 
            profitable candidate self-select. 
            <br><br>
            One of the main considerations when designing AMCs is whether the product being brought is technologically close or 
            technologically distant. What this distinction means in practice is will firms be able to largely use pre-existing R&D 
            to create the product and the AMC is to incentives capacity increases (technologically close) or will they have to invest 
            in this R&D as well as invest in capacity increases to create the product (technologically distant). 
            <br><br>
            The distant option is more like what we face with many CDR solutions. Things like DAC while in some form of operation 
            currently are clearly very far away from
