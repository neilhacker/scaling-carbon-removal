        <h2 >A hybrid funding approach</h2>
        </section>
        <section id="reasons">
        <p >
            If we look at some of the approaches above they all have useful characteristics but at least in the forms they have been used 
            in in the past are not directly suited to the CDR problem. Most of this comes from two factors:
            <br><br>
            - Technology readiness <a href="www.google.com">levels</a>
            <br>
            - Urgency
        </p>
        </section>
        <section id="trl">
        <p >
            The fact that many permenant CDR strategies today have somewhere between small and almost non-existant technological readiness
            level means that things like project financing are very unlikely to be able to happen in the ways they did for renewables. 
            In that setting it was pretty clear that a solar farm would generate a certain amount of electricity for a certain price, it was 
            just that this price was a bit more than market values and that the plants were expensive to make. In the CDR setting it is not clear
            yet how fast some approaches could scale and even if they do they will be much more expensive than other approaches for a 
            considerable time. The demand is therefore much less clear and the entities that would provide it would have to be doing so at rates
            above other, less permanent, approaches. 
            <br><br>
            AMCs could pool demand so that funding could be given to approaches that are currently more expensive but could get cheaper
            over time. There is however another issue we get to here. AMCs of the past have typically only been needed to incentivise 
            capacity building not R&D efforts. They've also typically been awarded to preexisting larger compnaies who if there is R&D
            to be done have preexisiting ways to finance it.  
            <br><br>
            These present a potential issue with CDR in that many of the companies are not large preexising players but instead many nascent
            groups all trying slightly different approaches and trying to scale up. This means that there will likely be considerable 
            cost in the R&D efforts that are much greater than what the traditional AMC model has typically had to try to solve for. 
            </p>
            </section>
            <section id="milestone">
            <p >
            Milestone based fuding also suffers as a lever due to the make up of the sector as it is typically a fairly bespoke process.
            You need to be able to judge how much something is likely to cost and then what a reasonable amount of government funding for 
            getting to that stage would be. If we think back to the COTS example there were only two companies getting funding from the 
            entire process. While in this case you can get away with a single company working it is very unlikely this will be the case 
            for CDR which will likely need a whole portfolio of options deployed. 
            <br><br>
            This means it would probably be incredibly difficult for the government to recreate the exact method of milestone based funding
            it used for COTS in the CDR framework.  
        </p>
        </section>
        <section id="urgency">
        <p >
            We could wait to see which technologies look more promising and then buy from those using traditional AMCs when they have 
            lower costs. We could even by this stage maybe used milestone based funding to help them scale up even more given that there 
            will be fewer players with more assessable technology and costs. The problem with this is our second factor <b>urgency</b>.
            While it would be much more convenient to wait for these technologies to become more mature we don't have time to let them do 
            that in their own course as we need to start scaling things right now.

                Some people will probably say COVID fits this descriptions and I do agree it has a number of lessons we can learn about 
                funding urgent problems. However, while we didn't know this at the time necessarily, the fact that mRNA vaccines were created 
                in 2 days from the virus sequence being published suggests that not a whole lot of new R&D was actually needed.
            </span>
            This suggests that we will need a hybrid of the approaches above that are created in such a way as to provide huge levels of buying 
            but also support a diverse number of hetrogeneous R&D efforts. What this might look like specifically is hard to say.

            <b>This combination 
            of having such huge demand for something that doesn't yet exist in any real scale but that needs to exist very very soon is not 
            something we've come across before.  It will require both buying mechanisms to create more stable demand but also funding mechanisms
            to help companies actually conduct the R&D that they need to do to even begin to access the scale required to make a dent in the problem.</b>
