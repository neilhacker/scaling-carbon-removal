            <h1 >Scaling up carbon removal</h1>
            <h3><b>By <a href="https://twitter.com/_neilhacker">Neil Hacker</a></b></h3>
            <p>(For the best experience read this essay on a screen wide enough to show margin notes)</p>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This document is meant to look at the problem of scaling up carbon removal, specifically with a focus on 
                the financial aspects of this. The main questions are:
                <ul>
                    <li>What should we be funding today
                    </li>
                    <li>How much might we expect to be spending/how does this change based on assumptions
                    </li>
                    <li>How might this funding come about/be focused 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you more interested in the technical details of various approaches then the recent(ish) 
                <a href="https://cdrprimer.org/">CDR Primer</a> is a great place to start. This essay is less about technical
                details and more about questions around resource allocation and costs. 
                <br><br>
                The main things I hope you take away from this document are:
                <ul>
                    <li>To be on track to hit 10Gt of CDR by 2050 we need to start scaling up our efforts a lot, and right now</li>
                    <li>We need to be channeling funding into many different types of CDR</li>
                    <li>especially a lot more funding into areas that might have much higher costs per tonne today but which have the 
                        likelihood to scale this cost down as we ramp up our use of them</li>
                    <li>If one of the main things we care about is hitting the target of 10Gt of removal a year then speed and cost are 
                        aligned, i.e the faster we scale the cheaper it will be in total</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                This document is a bit different to most in that I've tried to make calculations, somewhat, interactive and explained 
                step by step. Numbers in <b style="color:#66D268;">green</b> are reactive so you can click and drag them to change their value.
                Numbers in <b style="color:#7BBEF7;">blue</b> are ones that are calculated from a mixture of our reactive 
                values and constants. If you click on them I've tried to present the steps I went through to calculate them 
                in the margin.

            <p>
                This section aims to be a short bit of contextualizing of how much CO₂ we need to remove, how quickly we 
                need to ramp up our capabilities, and how much this could cost.

                   Hard to avoid emissions include emissions from sectors or processes that we don't have any viable decarbonised 
                   alternative for. For example, aviation, cement and steel production and many forms of agricultural emissions
                   all do not have clear alternatives that don't produce large quantities of CO₂. While these aren't the only 
                   reasons we need carbon removal these hard to avoid emissions will likely contribute 
                   <a href="https://cdrprimer.org/read/chapter-1#sec-1-4">≈1.5 - 3.1Gt CO₂eq</a> annually which we need someway of

                    If we just get to net zero then this will mean we still have around 410ppm of CO₂ in the atmosphere. Our pre-industrial 
                    level was around 280ppm. This means that the world will still be getting warmer, the oceans will still be becoming 
                    more acidic and we are at risk of tripping a number of ecological tipping points it will be very difficult to recover from.

                </span> 

    
                We currently emit about 35 gigatonnes of CO₂ annually, of this between 1.5 and 3.1 gigatonnes are classed as 
                <b style="cursor:pointer" onclick="sidebar('hard_to_avoid')">hard to avoid emissions</b>
                 and so it will be very difficult to stop producing any time soon. If we want to get to net zero then 
                we will almost certainly have to not only reduce emissions but also remove CO₂ from the atmosphere. The scale of 
                carbon removal will almost certainly want to be higher than this hard-to-avoid emission rate however, in fact the IPCC
                report suggests that we will want to be at the scale of <b>10Gt a year</b> of carbon removal by 2050. 
                <br><br>
                Why will we need to do more
                removal than just the hard-to-avoid emissions? Simply put it's because we will likely not get our emissions all the way down
                to just these sources and even then being at net-zero will not reverse the increase of atmospheric CO₂ it will only

            <h3>Scale of capacity</h3>
            <p>
                To reach our 10Gt target will require absolutely huge scale ups in current methods of CDR. 
                One question to ask is what would these scale ups resemble? Are they literally out of the 
                scope of anything we have done before or are they 'just merely' a lot?

                Many of the technologies above were/are heavily subsidized by governments around the world and received billions in funding from 
                governments for R&D. Many, specifically the energy related ones, have the added benefit of being general purpose 
                technologies which means that the demand for them if they get cheap enough is basically infinite. If solar became incredibly cheap
                then the question of who would want to buy it sorts itself out almost instantly. This helped enable a clear path to who would 
                buy the product if you could get it cheap enough, everyone.

                    We can use the equation \(C_x = C_1 x^{log_2(b)} \).
                    Going through each part of this we have:  <br>
                    \(C_x \) as the cost of the \(x^{th} \) unit <br>
                    \(C_1 \) is the cost of the \(1^{st} \) unit <br> 
                    \(b = 1- l \) where \( l \) is the learning rate, the decimal verion of the % decrease in cost per doubling of cumulative volume i.e 20% → 0.2 <br>
                    <br> 
                    Let's apply this to our example above. Now we don't know \(C_1 \) but there is a way to calculate it if you know 
                    what \(C_x \) for some value of \(x \) and the learning rate \(l \). If you do some rearranging you get 
                    \(C_1 = \dfrac{C_x}{x^{log_2(b)}} \). In our example the learning rate = 20% so \(b = 1- l  = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8\)
                    we also know that when \(x = 10 \) then \(C_x = 1000 \). Putting this all together we can get 
                    \(C_1 = \dfrac{1000}{10^{log_2(0.8)}} = 2098.6\). We can then plug this into our original equation to get the 
                    general form of \(C_x = 2098.6 x^{log_2(0.8)} \) and this is the equation of the line you see on the graph.

                A cost curve is a way of looking at the unit cost of a technology and how this changes as we scale up the production
                of this technology. Typically this involves describing the % decrease in unit price for a doubling in the 
                cumulative volume of this technology, we then call this % decrease in cost the learning rate. For example if a 
                technology gets 20% cheaper every time we double the cumulative volume of units made then it has a learning rate of 20%.
                If you want more info you can run through an example below or or <b style="cursor:pointer" onclick="sidebar('hi')">click here</b> to see how 
                we calculate the curve.

                    Let's say we are currently producing 10 units of a good at a price of $600 per unit.

                <r-visible :visible="sliderStep == 2" hidden="">
                    Over time we increase the total cumualtive units made first to 20 units then to 40 units. Each doubling of cumulative units
                    is associated with a 20% decrease in the per unit price of this good.

                <r-visible :visible="sliderStep == 3" hidden="">
                    We can then use these historic decreases in cost to forecast what the costs might look like in the future if this trend was

            <h3>Relevance to CDR</h3>
            <p>
                How might we expect things like DAC to scale down their costs? The short answer is we really aren't too sure 
                at the moment. This is one of the reasons why we need to be funding multiple shots at various approaches so we 
                can get a better understanding of what might scale and what might not. However, we can look at a few factors to at 
                least make some kind of informed guess.

                <b>Historical base rates</b>
                <br>
                Many frontier CDR strategies resemble, at a high level, many other industrial processes. They use energy, chemicals 
                require supporting infrastructure etc. While there is a reasonable range of learning rates for many comparable products 
                like this the below should give some indication of historically how we might orient our base rates.

                This chart is meant to be illustrative. These technologies did not all start with the same unit cost and 
                certainly didn't all manage to continue scaling cumulative capacity the same amounts as each other, transistors
                for example have scaled much more than anything else in this list and so have also seen much larger price declines. 
                What this chart is meant to do is show the range of learning rates various other technologies have experienced at some 
                point.

                <b>Material costs</b>
                <br>
                There is fair reason to think that costs might fall a fair amount on the material side. While it is of course not a 
                1-for-1 comparison 
                <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/EE/D1EE01313K">a study</a> looking to disentangle the various causes of price declines in lithium ion batteries found 
                that the largest contributor to these declines was R&D specifically around “advancements in chemistry and materials science”. 
                If we look at an estimated cost breakdown for solid sorbet DAC systems we can see that the largest single contributor is the 
                contractor array for which advances in material science, for example with MOF's, would be able to make large gains here.

                <b>Energy floor</b>
                <br>
                One potential issue with cost scaling for many of these approaches will be that energy might present somewhat of a price 
                floor. To be sure better chemistry could lead to less energy per ton to be needed and energy prices, especially renewable 
                ones which would be the ones powering our cdr systems, will likely fall more, but you can't scale costs down forever if you 
                have to pay for energy. Depending on the energy resource, capturing 1 MtCO2/yr requires
                <a href="https://cdrprimer.org/read/chapter-2">180 - 500 MW of power</a>, 
                at current prices (＄0.38 a Watt for solar) this would put a floor of, at minimum ＄68.4 to ＄190.
                <br><br>
                If we are at the higher end of this power usage limit then this price floor could prove to be a real obstacle to our ability 
                to scale at an affordable price.
                <br><br>
                This issue will depend a lot on the specific approach, energy prices/generation in the future, as well as R&D to lower a 
                specific approaches energy usage per ton. For example, DAC may be able to become more efficient at using its energy or may 
                be able to get access to cheaper and cheaper solar both of which would make the floor price lower. A different approach, such as 
                what Running Tide are doing with kelp uses energy from the sun which is free and so the floor for them can be a lot lower.

                    <br><br>
                    First we need to find the cumulative tonnes (Qb) of CO₂ we will have removed by the time we get to 10Gt annually.
                    We can do that by summing the tonnes removed each year with the equation below:
                    <br><br>
                    \( Q_b = \sum_{k=0}^{t} C (1+\dfrac{r}{100})^{k} \)
                    <br><br>
                    \(  = C \sum_{k=0}^{t} (1+\dfrac{r}{100})^{k} \)
                    <br><br>
                    Now this is the sum of a geometric series and so we can use the following closed form expression.
                    <br><br>
                    \( Q_b = C \dfrac{1-(1+\dfrac{r}{100})^{t+1}}{1-(1+\dfrac{r}{100})} \)
                    <br><br>
                    We need to make two adjustments to this to avoid double counting, these being subtracting the tonnes of CO₂ removed 
                    this year, and adding the cumulative tonnes removed up unitl this year.
                    <br><br>
                    \( Q_b = C \dfrac{1-(1+\dfrac{r}{100})^{t+1}}{1-(1+\dfrac{r}{100})} - C + Qa \)
                    <br><br>
                    \( Q_b = \) <r-display class="cumulativeScaleTo10Gt" onmouseover="hoverByClass('cumulativeScaleTo10Gt','#E4FFED')" 
                    bind="cumulativeScaleTo10Gt"></r-display> tonnes
                    <br><br>
                    Now we can use the same integral we used for the last example to calculate the total cost of these tonnes of CO₂ 
                    removed. To do this we will also need these values from before:
                    <br><br>
                    Qa =

                    bind="wrightsLawC1" ></r-display> (this is the same as in the previous example)
                    <br>

                    bind="wrightLearningCurve" after="%" min="0" max="100" step="0.1"></r-dynamic>
                    & b = 1 - L 
                    <br><br>
                    \( Total Cost ≈ \int_{Q_a -1}^{Q_b} C_1 x ^{log_2 (b)} dx \)
                    <br><br>
                    Total Cost = $<r-display class="totalCostToCbVolExample" onmouseover="hoverByClass('totalCostToCbVolExample','#E4FFED')" 
                    bind="totalCostToCbVolExample"></r-display>
                </span>
    
                Let's look at a slightly different case, we're going to look at the cost of scaling up annual volume 
                up to 10Gt a year. This time suppose we are currently removing 
                <r-dynamic class="currentCarbonRemovalAmount" onmouseover="hoverByClass('currentCarbonRemovalAmount','#E4FFED')" 
                bind="currentCarbonRemovalAmount"  min="0" max="10000" step="1"></r-dynamic> 
                tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere at a unit cost of 
                $<r-dynamic class="costperton" onmouseover="hoverByClass('costperton','#E4FFED')" 
                bind="costperton"  min="0" max="1000" step="1"></r-dynamic>. 
                To locate ourselves on the cost curve also suppose cumulatively we have removed 
                <r-dynamic class="cumulativeCarbonRemovalAmount" onmouseover="hoverByClass('cumulativeCarbonRemovalAmount','#E4FFED')" 
                bind="cumulativeCarbonRemovalAmount"  min="0" max="100000" step="1"></r-dynamic>
                tonnes of carbon in total & again our learning rate is 
                <r-dynamic class="wrightLearningCurve" onmouseover="hoverByClass('wrightLearningCurve','#E4FFED')" 
                bind="wrightLearningCurve" after="%" min="0" max="100" step="0.1"></r-dynamic>.
                Now if we increase our tonnes removed by 
                <r-dynamic class="yearlyIncreaseInTonnesPerc" onmouseover="hoverByClass('yearlyIncreaseInTonnesPerc','#E4FFED')" 
                bind="yearlyIncreaseInTonnesPerc"  min="0" max="100" after="%" step="1"></r-dynamic>
                a year in will take 
                <r-display class="yearsTo10Gt" onmouseover="hoverByClass('yearsTo10Gt','#E4FFED')" 
                bind="yearsTo10Gt" onclick="sidebar('yearsTo10Gt')"></r-display>
                years for us to reach a 10Gt scale and total cost of this increase will be approximately 
                $<r-display class="totalCostToCbVolExample" onmouseover="hoverByClass('totalCostToCbVolExample','#E4FFED')" 
                bind="totalCostToCbVolExample" onclick="sidebar('CbTo10Gt')"></r-display>.
                
                <br><br>
                <span class="marginnote" id="cost comparison graph">

                    ★
                </span>
    
                One thing to really emphasise about the example is the effect of changing the amount we are scaling up removal each year.
                Currently this is set to <r-dynamic class="yearlyIncreaseInTonnesPerc" onmouseover="hoverByClass('yearlyIncreaseInTonnesPerc','#E4FFED')" 
                bind="yearlyIncreaseInTonnesPerc"  min="0" max="100" after="%" step="1"></r-dynamic>
                & at this rate, with our other set values, it will take us 
                <r-display class="yearsTo10Gt" onmouseover="hoverByClass('yearsTo10Gt','#E4FFED')" 
                bind="yearsTo10Gt" onclick="sidebar('yearsTo10Gt')"></r-display> years 
                to get to our 10Gt of removal a year target. The thing I really want to emphasise is that if we increase the yearly 
                growth rate, while it means paying more in any given year it also means that the total cost to scale to our 10Gt 
                target actually <i>falls</i>. The reasoning for this is just that if we scale slowly then we are spending more 
                years still paying a lot for carbon removal but not actually yet at our target rate. This leads to the result 
                that in our race to 10Gt a year <b>increasing speed and minimising total cost work with not against each other</b>.           
            </p>
            <p>
                The above is clearly an oversimplification, we assume:
                <ul>
                    <li>A known, and constant, learning rate</li>
                    <li>A single learning rate across all approaches</li>
                    <li>Constant yearly scaling of capacity (sometimes at massive levels)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Hopefully it can still serve as a useful guide for the order of magnitude we might be expecting to pay at 
                and how important things like the learning rate are for our calculations.

            <h3>Portfolio of approaches</h3>
            <p>

                We can broadly split most CDR approaches into two main camps. 
                Camp one is nature based solutions. These are things like afforestation & reforestation, soil sequestration, 
                biochar and ocean interventions. Camp two are technological solutions; these mainly include DAC and enhanced weathering. 
                Some interventions somewhat fall into both camps such as BECCS, genetically modifying trees/plants/plankton to capture 
                <label for="mn_3_1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
                <input type="checkbox" id="mn-mn_3_1" class="margin-toggle"/>
                <span class="marginnote" id="id_option">
                    ¹ For example, Charm Industrial uses this process and is currently 
                    <a href="https://charmindustrial.com/blog/largest-permanent-carbon-removal-delivery-of-all-time">the market leader</a> in permenant tonnes of CO₂ removed. 
                </span> 
                more CO₂ and biomass carbon removal and storage¹. 


                <br><br>
                Again broadly each class of solutions has some common drawbacks that mean using any single intervention would likely 
                struggle to get to the full scale we need.
                <br>
                - Nature based solutions have land and water use as major constraints to how much we can expect them to be able to scale.
                <br> 
                - Technological solutions tend to have energy and therefore cost as major barriers to scaling up.
                <br><br>
                It should be noted as well that these two groups also tend to differ more in other ways. Nature based solutions tend to 
                simply impact humans in more ways than technological ones and so have as we mentioned downsides in terms of water/land 
                usage but also tend to have more co-benefits than technological ones such as improving biodiversity. 
                <br><br>
                Another broad difference is in terms of permanence. Nature based solutions tend to have lower levels of permanence guarantees 
                than technological solutions or BECCS. This is largely because the process is more easily reversible. Trees can be cut or 
                burnt down, soil or agricultural practices can change, all of which lose some of the benefits from these approaches. 
                Technological solutions typically involve much more permanent forms of sequestration like injecting carbon underground or 
                using it to cure cement. These are very difficult to reverse and so are much more likely to keep carbon locked away for a 
                long time. Long term storage is so difficult to find at the moment that in their recent 
                <a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4MDlc">2021 report</a> Microsoft said that >99% of their 
                purchases ended up coming from short term natural solutions.
            
                <br><br>
                Another large difference is additionality. This isn't such a large issue when it comes to looking at theoretical amounts 
                of CDR that could be created but can be an issue when looking at specifically which things to be funding. For example, we 
                might know that soils could sequester …. more carbon with certain practices, however, we need to direct funds to specific 
                soil projects and some of the time it might not be so clear if a particular project would lead to an increase in CDR vs the 
                counterfactual.
                <br><br>  
                Technological solutions again are usually much more clear about their additionality. If you put a big fan somewhere and 
                it sucks 4000 tons of CO₂ a year you can be pretty sure that this is 4000 more tons of CO₂ removed from the air than if 
                there was no big fan. This is somewhat of an oversimplification, in reality you need to look at the lifecycle analysis of 
                the whole cdr system to see what the additionality would be, i.e what carbon was produced to make the system, to power it, 
                to transport and store the carbon? Still while these things add complexity the counterfactual is much clearer. 
                <br><br>

                </span>
                Despite it seeming like technological solutions have an edge in many different areas, it should be taken from the above to 
                suggest that they are better. Two things should be made clear. 
                <br>
                - We will <b>almost certainly need both</b> technological and nature based solutions
                <br> 
                - <b>At the moment technological ones cost a lot</b>. 
                <br><br>
                In fact if we look at this table from the <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/25259/chapter/2#5">NAS report</a> the levels of 
                “Safe Potential Rate of CO2 Removal Possible Given Current Technology and Understanding and at ≤$100/t CO2” for 
                DAC is 0, because at the moment it is just so expensive. In a similar vein the rates for carbon mineralisation 
                are unknown as the tech is simply so untested at scale.

                    You might say that this is an unfair comparison as if we have multiple approaches all starting from the same level

                This is going to be a bit coarse but one clear benefit of having multiple approaches (and this also holds to some extent

            <p>
                In some ways this serves a similar function to the 
                portfolio of approaches. Any given project/specific instantiation of an approach, may have certain scale limitations 
                placed upon it. You might want to scale up a specific type of carbon mineralisation but maybe at some point you will 
                hit real difficulties obtaining the needed materials. 
                </br></br>
                There is of course another reason why you would want a portfolio of approaches within any given category and that is 
                because many of them will fail. This could be because the science just doesn't end up being able to scale, but we couldn't 
                know that until we tried. It might be for more normal reasons like founders falling out or simple project financing failures. 
                It also might be because even though some approaches might get us to scale eventually some will be able to do it faster, and 
                again we might simply not be able to tell until we try.

                quickly things could scale, then this <b>almost certainly requires us to cast a wide net</b> and fund many options in order 
                to end up backing the handful that do work.

            <h2>Allocation</h2>
            <p>
                This model is meant to show the effects of how we chose to spend money today. Does it matter if we spend all our money on 
                the cheapest option today waiting until that can't scale anymore before focusing on other solutions. Or, will it help/be 
                necessary to start spending <b>now</b> in order to give us a reasonable chance of getting various solutions to useful 
                scales?
                <br><br>
                The basic set up is that there will be two scenarios:
                <br>
                - <b>Scenario 1</b>: we will look to see how much we would need to scale up each CDR approach every year for them to reach their full capacity
                in 30 years time and then spend enough every year to make that scale up happen. This is mainly so that we have a budget
                we know it is possible to use to fully scale these technologies if they were funded in parallel 
                <br>
                - <b>Scenario 2</b>: we take the same yearly budget from scenario 1 but this time we spend it entirely on our cheap technology (Tech A)
                until the yearly budget would mean that that reaches full capacity. We then continue spending this much on it every year but 
                now spend all the residual budget on what is currently the more expensive option (Tech B) and see how this effects its ability
                to get to full scale.

                The picture we see is that given a certain budget if we spend it like in scenario 2 we will not manage to fully scale up 
                Technology B by our target date. I want to emphasise that this effect is fully an allocation effect. We know if we spent 
                the money differently (scenario 1) that we could have both technologies at full capacity by this date.
                <br><br>
                Why does this effect occur? Largely it is because if we start scaling tech B up starting right now we will have cumulatively
                made many more units of it and so the unit costs will have fallen much more than if we try to scale it up very quickly. This 
                means for any given budget if we can start getting the costs down today by starting to ramp up usage we should otherwise we 
                will find ourselves in the position of having to pay a much higher average unit price for it in the future.
                <br><br>

                    ★
                </span>
                In the model above then what we see is that in scenario 2 we therefore often don't have enough of a budget to scale this
                technology all the way up to its full capacity. The news is actually even worse than that. <b>Money and time are not fungible</b>.
                To some extent we can choose to pay more to do something faster but there are limits to this. 
                <br><br>
                In scenario 2 in the model above we often don't start producing technology B until 5 or so years before the deadline. This 
                turns what is already a hefty scale up rate of … if we start today to something closer to …. a year. There comes a time when 
                this rate is simply beyond what we are likely to be able to sustain no matter how much we spend. 
                <br><br>
                There are two main reasons why we might not, for any amount, be able to buy our way out of this scale up problem. If asked 
                how you would get to the moon in the 1600's you would maybe have suggested a very large and strong balloon. In reality though
                no amount of money you could have spent back then would have got you to your objective. You needed multiple breakthroughs 
                like calculus, orbital mechanics, the theory of propulsion engines, computers, to create the vehicle needed. Similarly if 
                we wait too long to start scaling up Tech B then we deprive ourselves of the time needed to make unforeseen advances that 
                might well be needed if we are to actually get to certain massive scales.
                <br><br>
                The other reason is more practical. It might simply not be possible to repurpose existing parts of the economy fast enough 
                or on a large enough scale to reach such a large annual scale up so quickly. It would involve the retraining of millions of 
                people, the reallocation of vast sections of the chemical and other industries. These things might be only financial issues 
                in models but they exist as actual constraints in the real world.

                    ★
                </span>
                The outcome of all of this is that <b>it may not just be cheaper to start aggressively scaling things like technology B today, 
                but it might be our only option if we really want to have it available for us to use in the future at the scales we will need 
                it in.</b>

            <p>
                One general point to make is that obviously this is a two sided market you have companies that are creating a service 
                (cdr) and buyers who are buying the service (tons of carbon removed) How we think about the two sides though is quite 
                different. The supply side, for technological solutions, is going to be made up of a handful of firms who need money, 
                but also talent. The demand side will be made up of buyers who by in large will only be providing money. 
                <br><br>
                The supply side will be providing a semi-commodity but the semi distinction is an important one, geologic storage in one 
                place is to a large extent analogous to geologic storage in another (LCAs being equivalent and all), but geologic storage 
                in one place and a forest in another really aren't the same, for reasons hopefully made clear by now. The demand side is 
                providing something much closer to a commodity good, money. Again there are important reasons why it is not a strict 
                commodity, getting your product brought in a guaranteed way over a long time horizon creates opportunities that selling 
                one offs to any willing customer doesn't but the point stands that on the scale of commodityness the demand side is much 
                more fungible. 
                <br><br>
                It is also drawing from a much wider area, or in other words there are more dollars that could in principle be spent on 
                buying CDR than there are scientists and engineers who could work on it. For these reasons it would be exceptionally 
                unfortunate if the demand side was ever the bottleneck holding up progress. 
                <br><br>
                It should, as much as we can, be the case that if something is slowing down the scaling of potentially variable cdr 
                strategies it is because running and scaling a frontier tech company is difficult, not because no one will buy your 
                stuff. (and even then we should be trying to make the company bit easier). In a situation as critical as reaching our 
                cdr targets, missing them because of not having enough money would be the most unfortunate and lamentable reason possible.
                <br><br>
                While mentioned earlier that a ton is not a ton is not a ton it is also true to some extent that a dollar is not a dollar 
                is not a dollar.

                Given the global importance of reducing carbon in the atmosphere you would expect governments to be playing a very 
                large role in trying to help these technologies become cheaper. The good news is that governments are starting to ramp 
                up funding for these technologies
                <br><br>
                <b>Grants</b>
                <br>
                The UK has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/direct-air-capture-and-other-greenhouse-gas-removal-technologies-competition/projects-selected-for-phase-1-of-the-direct-air-capture-and-greenhouse-gas-removal-programme">
                just announced the 24 projects</a> it will be backing for experiments into DAC. They have 
                <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-a-new-deal-for-britain">also announced up to $100m</a>
                in new funding for DAC R&D.
                <br><br>
                The US government similarly has recently put out a request for information from their newly formed department of 
                fossil energy and carbon management for things to look into funding and they have currently put aside a budget of … 
                for direct R&D funding for frontier cdr areas. The 
                <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/17/1056646775/the-infrastructure-bill-could-boost-the-industry-removing-carbon-dioxide-from-th">recent infrastructure bill contains more than</a> 
                ＄12bn for carbon capture, removal and storage. New York is also putting aside $3.5bn specifically for DAC. The recent 
                Office for fossile energy and carbon management had a 
                <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2020/02/f71/FY%202021%20Budget%20in%20Brief%20Fact%20Sheet_2.pdf">fiscal year 2021 budget of $123M</a> 
                for carbon capture, utilization, and storage.
                It is worth noting though that while part of this funding will likely end up benefiting long term CDR not all of the approaches that 
                fit in this category are directly related to what we are talking about here. For example point source capture is more a way to 
                reduce emissions from polluting plants and as such would not typically be regarded as carbon removal even though it is carbon capture.
                The departments recent <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/Budget%20in%20Brief%20Fact%20Sheet%20FY%202022.pdf">2022 budget request</a> 
                does have a new line item specifically for carbon removal of ＄63m.
                <br><br>
                These suggest that governments are starting to really scale up their funding for CDR R&D which will be crucial to help create 
                the technologies and demonstration plants needed to start to scale up properly. 
            
                <br><br>
    
                <b>VC</b>
                <br>
                VC money is also rapidly moving into the cdr space. There are a few caveats however. Ultimately vc's aim to make money 
                from their investments. There are two ways for cdr companies to make money, the first is to sell the actual long term 
                removal of CO₂ either on a voluntary market or to the government, the other is to use the CO₂ in a product that also 
                sequesters long term (e.g carbon cure). 
                <br><br>
                One issue with the second option is that as Klaus Lacker points out we create far more CO₂ than all the gravel and sand 
                output in the world so while these types of approaches could scale a lot they will almost certainly not take us enough 
                of the way.
                <br><br>
                An issue with the former, sell to companies/governments, is that the very companies that might need vc dollars the most i.e 
                high tech not ready for market yet, are also the ones who produce a good at above market rate and so may not be able to 
                find a steady stream of buyers. To some extent this doesn't seem to have been too bad as companies like carbon engineering 
                or climeworks have seen large amounts of funding but it still is likely holding back even more money from moving in.
                <br><br>
                <b>Project finance</b>
                <br>
                Project finance is a typical way by which long term infrastructure projects are able to pay for their 
                creation/construction which typically involve using the projects expected cashflows for repayments. This kind of 
                financing is one of the primary vehicles renewable company used to scale projects and will likely be crucial for the 
                scaling up of various cdr approaches as well. 
                <br><br>
                Project finance is intimately linked to the demand side of the equation as you are typically directly using cashflows to 
                get the financing in the first place. What this allows is for the scale up of much large infrastructure facilities, and 
                in a non dilutive way. Many CDR strategies are simply too early and in too much of an immature market to be able to 
                sell their tons of carbon removed in this way allowing them to scale. 
                <br><br>
                Also the more nascent approaches have the added problem of trying to sell tons removed well above 'market rates', which
                creates the problem of who would buy them → little demand → can't get financing → can't scale → can't get cheaper.
                <br><br>
                This is clearly not a totally preventative problem, companies are still getting government and VC funding but project financing
                allows access to truly massive scale of capital and in the race to 10Gt even though we have other funding avenues every one 
                is crucial. 
                <br><br>
                <b>Milestone based funding</b>
                <br>
                One of the most effective blends of government funding with private companies came from the NASA COTS programme in the 
                early 2000s. The US was decommissioning the space shuttle and needed a way to run resupply missions to the ISS without 
                having to pay another country to do it. What they did was to effectively run a request for proposals for any companies 
                who wanted to propose a launch system. These were then assessed on a number of factors, likelihood of technically working, 
                cost etc, and then ultimately two companies were chosen.
                <br><br>
                There were a few main differences to this kind of process to normal government procurement:
                <ul>
                    <li> 
                        The government only gave specifications on what needed to be achieved not the specific methods by which to 
                        achieve them (result oriented not process oriented)
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        They paid out based on milestones rather than a cost plus model. If the company hit a certain technical milestone 
                        on their roadmap the government gave them a set amount of money. This put more risk onto the individual companies 
                        as they would be responsible for paying for cost overruns. It also meant the government only paid out as specific 
                        progress was made. This helped derisk the government from massive cost overruns.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The end result was that one of the companies funded was spacex and the government saw its costs to resupply the ISS plummet 
                by almost an order of magnitude while at the same time the most successful space company in the world was able to be born.
                <br><br>
                This kind of approach seems to lend itself almost perfectly to the position we are in with CDR.

                <b>Voluntary carbon market</b>
                <br>
                One thing that is happening today are that private companies like stripe, shopify and microsoft, are coming into the carbon 
                removal space and offering to buy removal capacity far above market rates in order to try to help various companies scale 
                and move down their cost curves. 
                <br><br>
                When stripe started their carbon purchasing they started with $1m, which is an insanely small amount and yet they reported 
                that this amount of capital was at the time a huge deal for the companies involved. In fact stripe has gone on to be the 
                literal first customer of a number of the companies they back.
                <br><br>
                While the figures are not yet public stripe has also allowed companies on their platform to directly contribute a percentage 
                of their revenue towards the companies stripe is buying from thus providing what is likely a reasonably sized, and maybe more 
                importantly recurring, source of funds for these companies. 
                <br><br>
                Voluntary carbon markets for frontier cdr approaches are still not very large though. Some of this is a supply issue, 
                microsoft found it actually impossible given the submissions they had for their spending to find enough long term 
                sequestration companies to get to their net zero targets. Some of the issue though is demand based. At the moment net-zero 
                pledges largely treat a ton of carbon removed by a forest the same as one that is injected underground or mineralised. 
                While we will need to scale up nature based solutions as well what this does is mean that many companies if they are simply 
                trying to hit their net zero target do not have an incentive currently to buy the well above market priced carbon removal 
                from the more frontier approaches.   
                <br><br>
                <b>Carbon purchase agreements</b>
                <br>
                Energy sources such as solar and wind benefitted massively from Power purchase agreements (PPAs) which were long term agreements by companies/governments 
                to buy energy from specific projects. This enabled these projects to literally take this commitment to the bank where they 
                could then raise project financing to either expand their portfolio of renewable energy projects or build specific ones using 
                the agreement.
                <br><br>
                Buying a few years worth of RECs from a renewable project does not provide the stable and sizable cash stream that a 
                renewable project developer needs to get financing to build new green power projects. In a PPA, Google is agreeing to buy 
                all the power from a project for many years. Google has, in effect, totally accepted the power price risk that the project
                owner would otherwise face—instead of taking the risk of selling into the power market on a short-term basis, Google is 
                providing the seller with a guaranteed revenue stream for 20 years. This is something the developer can literally take to 
                the bank”
                <br><br>
                Google emphasises this bankability later in the document as well where they say that if they only brought the RECs this would
                provide the energy providers with only a fraction of the benefit of going all in with a PPA. It is interesting to contrast 
                this with the way voluntary carbon markets work today. Currently we are largely in the buying just the REC phase of many 
                markets, especially for frontier technologies.
                <br><br>
                It should be noted that the UK currently has the Woodland Carbon Guarantee which allows for the option to sell captured 
                carbon to the government at a guaranteed price. This is a great initiative and should probably be copied more around the 
                world, however, it still doesn't necessarily help frontier companies. If they are likely to produce a tonne of removed 
                carbon for well above the price guarantee then selling to the government does little to help them gain a positive expected 
                value with which to finance their projects. In their case they may well need much more specific agreements for buying from 
                their specific facilities with the expectation that the carbon removed will have a higher price per tonne than other sources
                but that this will allow these companies to fund more project expansion to move down their cost curves.
                <br><br>
                This doesn't really happen at the moment. We see some companies like stripe or shopify that are buying from frontier companies
                at above market rates but not necessarily in a more formalised long term way. This is not necessarily a bug, at least at 
                this point. …explore vs exploit …etc
                <br><br>
                There are some big differences between what google did and what might/does need to be done with CDR. Google specifically 
                says that they “always try to buy renewable energy from the most cost-competitive sources within the grids where we operate.” 
    
                <br><br>
                <b>Advanced market commitments</b>
                <br>
                Advanced market commitments are when some group guarantees to buy a given output as long as a certain set of criteria 
                is met. For example back in 2009 there was a $1.5bn AMC to buy pneumococcal vaccines for developing countries. The idea was 
                that the AMC allows both market forces and subsidy like interventions to interact to help create conditions that private 
                firms would find more favorable to go and try to create a vaccine candidate in. One of the main reasons the AMC is so useful 
                is that it avoids having to pick which companies to buy from ex-ante and instead lets companies that believe they can make a 
                profitable candidate self-select. 
                <br><br>
                One of the main considerations when designing AMCs is whether the product being brought is technologically close or 
                technologically distant. What this distinction means in practice is will firms be able to largely use pre-existing R&D 
                to create the product and the AMC is to incentives capacity increases (technologically close) or will they have to invest 
                in this R&D as well as invest in capacity increases to create the product (technologically distant). 
                <br><br>
                The distant option is more like what we face with many CDR solutions. Things like DAC while in some form of operation 
                currently are clearly very far away from

            <h3>Regulation</h3>
            <p>
                I'm not going to go too far into regulation in this post as it could easily expand to be just as long as everything else. 
                What I do want to point out is the virtuous cycle that some regulation could provide. If we start pricing carbon at a higher 
                rate then we enable companies who at the moment have a very expensive product to effectively get a subsidy towards this. This 
                would mean that they can become more price competitive which in turn might mean that there will be more and more consistent demand.
                <br><br>
                This can help enable these approaches to access more capital and so scale more to meet this demand in the process removing 
                more and more CO₂ from the atmosphere.

        <section id="Hybrid&nbsp;funding&nbsp;approach">
            <h2>A hybrid funding approach</h2>
            <p>
                If we look at some of the approaches above they all have useful characteristics but at least in the forms they have been used 
                in in the past are not directly suited to the CDR problem. Most of this comes from two factors:
                <br><br>
                - Technology readiness levels
                <br>
                - Urgency
                <br><br>
                The fact that many permanent CDR strategies today have somewhere between small and almost non-existant technological readiness
                level means that things like project financing are very unlikely to be able to happen in the ways they did for renewables. 
                In that setting it was pretty clear that a solar farm would generate a certain amount of electricity for a certain price, it was 
                just that this price was a bit more than market values and that the plants were expensive to make. In the CDR setting it is not clear
                yet how fast some approaches could scale and even if they do they will be much more expensive than other approaches for a 
                considerable time. The demand is therefore much less clear and the entities that would provide it would have to be doing so at rates
                above other, less permanent, approaches. 
                <br><br>
                AMCs could pool demand so that funding could be given to approaches that are currently more expensive but could get cheaper
                over time. There is however another issue we get to here. AMCs of the past have typically only been needed to incentivise 
                capacity building not R&D efforts. They've also typically been awarded to preexisting larger companies who if there is R&D
                to be done have preexisting ways to finance it.  
                <br><br>
                These present a potential issue with CDR in that many of the companies are not large preexisting players but instead many nascent
                groups all trying slightly different approaches and trying to scale up. This means that there will likely be considerable 
                cost in the R&D efforts that are much greater than what the traditional AMC model has typically had to try to solve for. 
                <br><br>
                Milestone based funding also suffers as a lever due to the make up of the sector as it is typically a fairly bespoke process.
                You need to be able to judge how much something is likely to cost and then what a reasonable amount of government funding for 
                getting to that stage would be. If we think back to the COTS example there were only two companies getting funding from the 
                entire process. While in this case you can get away with a single company working it is very unlikely this will be the case 
                for CDR which will likely need a whole portfolio of options deployed. 
                <br><br>
                This means it would probably be incredibly difficult for the government to recreate the exact method of milestone based funding
                it used for COTS in the CDR framework.  
                <br><br>
                We could wait to see which technologies look more promising and then buy from those using traditional AMCs when they have 
                lower costs. We could even by this stage maybe used milestone based funding to help them scale up even more given that there 
                will be fewer players with more assessable technology and costs. The problem with this is our second factor <b>urgency</b>.
                While it would be much more convenient to wait for these technologies to become more mature we don't have time to let them do 
                that in their own course as we need to start scaling things right now.

                    Some people will probably say COVID fits this descriptions and I do agree it has a number of lessons we can learn about 
                    funding urgent problems. However, while we didn't know this at the time necessarily, the fact that mRNA vaccines were created 
                    in 2 days from the virus sequence being published suggests that not a whole lot of new R&D was actually needed.
                </span>
                This suggests that we will need a hybrid of the approaches above that are created in such a way as to provide huge levels of buying 
                but also support a diverse number of heterogeneous R&D efforts. What this might look like specifically is hard to say.

                <b>This combination 
                of having such a huge demand for something that doesn't yet exist in any real scale but that needs to exist very very soon is not 
                something we've come across before.  It will require both buying mechanisms to create more stable demand but also funding mechanisms
                to help companies actually conduct the R&D that they need to do to even begin to access the scale required to make a dent in the problem.</b>
