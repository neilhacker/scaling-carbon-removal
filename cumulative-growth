This is just a note on how cumulative growth (i.e of tonnes of carbon removed) was calculated:

we have:
y = C * r^x

y = tonnes removed at time x
C = tonnes removed at time 0 (current tonnes removed)
r = rate of growth of tonnes removed (20% increase a year -> r=1.2)
x = year &or time

we want to calculate âˆ‘Cr^x from 0 to n

= C * (1-r^(n+1))/(1-r)
